# FAQ

<Qna>
Q. What is this locked big chest in the middle of The Ice Palace?
A. Welcome to A Day Out!
This special world contains six very hard levels. These levels were simple yet extremely hard to be in The Ice Palace, so we gathered those to make a new world. Dare solve it?

Q. In the first level “Easy Mode”, boxes keep block the narrow hole next to the start position. It’s very annoying.
A. Down + Jump = Fall off from a box.
You don’t have to know this, but it will make your life much easier.

Q. This level is too hard, I need a hint.
A. Alright, we can give you hints.
Sometimes, to halt the game and start logical deduction helps. But if you still think it’s too hard, feel free to contact me or other devs. Or you can just add a reply on this topic thread. We can give you a hint. Also, please feel free to share your hints and solutions! We don’t mind it as long as you take care of the [spoiler]spoilers[/spoiler].

Q. This level is logically impossible and I can prove it!
A. You missed something.
Believe me, all gems are collectible.
Have you got the diamond in the Void - Escalate? How about the ruby in the Last Tapestry - Flight? Did you think those levels are also impossible at the first glance? Well, I did actually.
Or maybe it’s the case which you missed some unusual control tricks, just like some key moves in some maps. Do you remember yourself solving The Void - Grasp?
We have found some other original tricks. Some levels are completely built on it, which may seem to be logically impossible to solve until you get the trick. You could solve it when you catch the trick.

Q. I hate jars.
A. Good.
Working as intended.

Q. Bug! Strange behavior!
A. It doesn’t change anything.
Oobleck in aqua mortua: Wow, you are pretty quick-witted. You reached Low Tide, right? It’s actually a hidden feature that Portponky made. It doesn’t change anything though, we didn’t want to actively use it.
Submerged ledge: Portponky was too lazy to make properly working submerged ledge, so they are actually translucent solid blocks. Fear not! We designed levels very carefully to make sure it doesn’t change anything.
There were several other non-intuitive behaviors (such as making the second paradox by entering a cauldron, instead of leaving a room) which are really hard to understand, but no puzzle exploits them, so relax.

Q. Is there any hint for the locations of diamonds/rubies, or at least a number of them?
A. Yep.
For The Ice Palace - yes, two rooms contain hints. One room shows the total number of each of the gems. Another room shows the exact locations of them. Navigate rooms carefully.
For A Day Out - no. We believe you already realized how to distinguish whether a level contains bonus gems or not by now.

Q. Are you going to translate the mission names?
A. Nah.
We can’t do all the translations job - we know you can read English, ‘cuz this sentence is written in English.

Q. Will this DLC be updated?
A. Maybe, maybe not.
If more great custom levels are made or we desperately have to remove some unexpected alternative solutions. But since we have no way to notice it to you, we will try to update it as least as possible. The current version is v1.0.
We have no way to automatically update your game since this DLC is not an official one. You need to manually update it by installing it again.

Q. How can I remove this DLC?
A. How sad! You don’t.
Just kidding. In the zip file you downloaded, there’s the uninstall file. Execute “uninstall-Windows.bat” or “uninstall-Mac.sh” depending on your OS, and find your Steam folder. This will remove this DLC without erasing your whole progress. When you re-install the DLC, your progress will still be there.
