## Welcome to The Ice Palace!

[Recursed: The Ice Palace](https://recursed-ice-palace.github.io) is a free
community DLC for the puzzle game [Recursed](https://store.steampowered.com/app/497780/Recursed/),
filled with carefully crafted and extremely challenging puzzles.

## What is it?
Itâ€™s a DLC world, just like The Oobleck Conundrum or The Last Tapestry.
But instead of introducing a new item, it features a collection of good custom levels
that community members made.

## Is it difficult?
Yes. \*nod nod\* So we locked up The Ice Palace until you see the ending.
Even though you already saw the ending, *we recommend you to get most of the gems first*,
including The Oobleck Conundrum and The Last Tapestry.

First few levels would be easy, but increasingly difficult levels will appear as you progress.
Oh, by the way, the difficulty is evaluated only by the crystal puzzle.

## Obligatory Feature List

- 18+ challenging puzzles
- 20+ hours of playtime
- Mind-blowing new tricks
- Thoroughly tested by beta testers
- Beautifully designed tiles and backgrounds
- Chests, jars, cauldrons, and more!
